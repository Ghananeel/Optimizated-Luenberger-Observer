# Optimizated-Luenberger-Observer
A convex programming oriented observer design method for LTI systems. The observer gain design problem is formulated as a LMI and solved using CVX

The file pdf file contains the formulation and the details of the numerical simulation code wriiten in MATLAB 2O2Oa.
The matlab requires the CVX package which can be downloaded for free.
